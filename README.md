An app to start fitness, written in C++


## What it does

### Why is it special?

## How it works

Uses the traditional client/server model. The end result is to have a server  
that stores all user data, and have users use a client to access it and change  
it.

In the [src](https://github.com/teamwolfbytes/fitstart/tree/main/src) directory,  
you will find two folders named server and client. Inside those directories,  
will find two programs named `server.cpp` and `client.cpp`. Those files are the  
source for the server-side application and the client-side application.
