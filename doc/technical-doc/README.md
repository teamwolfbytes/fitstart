# Who this is for

This document is meant to be a sort of reference manual to the inner workings
of `fitstart`. All of the stuff in `technical-doc` is meant to be read with an
okay-ish understanding of C++. It was not created with the purpose for everyone
to be able to understand it easily, though hopefully most parts should make
sense even so.
